 NSU Hospital Management System

Description:
The NSU Hospital Management System is a C-based program designed to streamline and automate the management of hospital operations, particularly focusing on patient interactions. This system provides a centralized platform for patients to register, log in, view doctor availability, book appointments, and manage payments. It also helps hospitals efficiently manage doctor schedules, patient records, and financial transactions.
The program is built with a user-friendly, menu-driven interface that ensures ease of use for patients, doctors, and hospital administrators. It incorporates features such as patient registration, doctor information display, appointment booking, payment processing, and overdue payment tracking. By automating these processes, the system reduces manual errors, saves time, and enhances the overall efficiency of hospital operations. The NSU Hospital Management System employs a variety of programming concepts in C, ranging from basic input/output and control structures to more advanced features such as structures, pointers, and modular programming. These elements work in harmony to create a functional, efficient, and user-friendly system. By understanding and applying these concepts, the program successfully simplifies hospital management and enhances the patient experience.

Key Components of the System: 
	Patient Management:
New patients can register by providing their personal details (name, age, gender, contact information, username, and password).
Existing patients can log in using their credentials to access the system.

	Doctor Management:
A predefined list of doctors is maintained, including their specialization, availability, and consultation fees.
Patients can view this list to choose a doctor based on their needs.

	Appointment Booking:
Patients can book appointments with available doctors by selecting a date and time.
The system ensures that appointments are booked only for available slots and prevents overbooking.

	Payment System:
Patients must pay a consultation fee to confirm their appointment.
The system tracks payments and ensures appointments are confirmed only after successful payment.

	Overdue Payment Tracking:
The system tracks unpaid appointments and marks them as overdue.
Patients with overdue payments cannot book new appointments until their dues are cleared.

	User-Friendly Interface:
The system uses a simple, menu-driven interface that makes it easy for patients to navigate and perform tasks.
